### Performance Metrics

From the Air France Case Study data obtained from DoubleClick, the important performance metrics considered for optimizing publisher and campaign strategy are:

- **CTR**: Click Through Rate (Engine Click Thru % in the Excel sheet) is the percentage of customers who click through the link out of those who view it. It helps to understand how the ads perform in terms of user engagement.

- **TCR**: Transaction Conversion Rate (Trans. Conv. Rate % in the Excel sheet) is the percentage of customers who make transactions (purchases) out of those who click through the link.

- **Take Rate**: This metric helps to understand the purchase likelihood, calculated by multiplying CTR and TCR.

- **Actual CPC**: Cost Per Click is the actual cost paid by the advertiser each time the user clicks on an advertisement.

- **Net Revenue**: The amount earned after deducting the expenses, calculated as Revenue â€“ Cost.

- **ROA**: Return On Ads (Net Revenue/Cost) is the revenue generated for every dollar spent on ads.

### Optimize Publisher and Campaign Strategy

Metrics like **Take Rate** and **Average Cost per Click (CPC)** help analyze how a publisher is performing. The optimal strategy is achieved by improving the Take Rate and reducing the CPC. 

From the analysis, the following recommendations are made:

- **Yahoo-US** and **MSN-Global** should cut costs on campaigns that are not performing well.
- **MSN-Global** has the best marketing campaign results with a high **ROA**, but they should focus on improving their impressions and clicks to enhance visibility.
- High-cost publishers like **MSN-US** and **Google** are not driving enough purchases and should focus on strengthening their **TCR**.
- Low-cost publishers like **Overture (Global and US)** could drive more profitable marketing campaigns by improving both **CTR** and **TCR**.

### Optimize Campaign Strategy (Google and Yahoo)

Campaign strategy can be optimized by analyzing metrics like **CTR** and **TCR** for each campaign within a publisher. 

For **Google**:

- The **Geo Targeted Miami** campaign is performing well with high **CTR** and **TCR**, and it should maintain these performance levels.
- The **Air France Branded** campaign should consider search-side improvements, such as refining keywords or ad texts, to increase the **CTR**.
- Campaigns with a **CTR** of more than 15% should focus on web-side improvements (e.g., enhancing the landing page experience) to drive conversions, as customers are clicking through but not completing purchases.

For **Yahoo**:

- Campaign optimization for Yahoo should focus on the same strategies: enhancing CTR through better ad text and targeting, and improving the customer journey on the web-side for campaigns that already have a high CTR but low conversion rates.

- **Western Europe Destinations** and **Geo Targeted DC** campaigns have better **TCR** but could benefit from increasing their **CTR**. Search-side improvements, such as refining keywords or improving ad texts, could help increase user engagement, thereby driving more clicks and ultimately leading to higher profits.

- Low-profit campaigns with minimal to zero **TCR** should be considered for discontinuation to optimize overall performance and reduce unnecessary costs.

### KPI Impact (Considering CPC Only)

The primary **KPI** considered is **ROA (Return on Ads)**. By focusing on optimizing **Cost Per Click (CPC)**, key insights can be derived:

- The top candidates for optimization are **Yahoo-US** and **MSN-Global**. Implementing the recommended changes could significantly improve their ROA.

- Reducing the CPC by **10%** for **Yahoo-US** and **MSN-Global** would reduce their costs by the same margin. The new ROA is estimated to be approximately **1.15x** and **1.95x** their current ROA, respectively.

- **Overture-Global** and **Overture-US** need to focus on improving their **take rate**. Changing CPC for these publishers would not lead to a significant improvement in ROA, so these publishers are not ideal candidates for CPC-based optimizations.

- Publishers like **Google-Global**, **Google-US**, and **MSN-US** have minimal to moderate **take rates**. These publishers need to focus on improving their **CTR** and **TCR** to generate more revenue. Although reducing CPC would lead to a marginal increase in ROA, boosting **TCR** would have a much more impactful result.

- For example, **MSN-US** has a **TCR of 0** for most campaigns (as derived from the double-click data). Improving their **transaction conversion rate** should be the primary focus to drive profits.

- For the publisher **Kayak**, reducing costs by **10%** resulted in an **11% improvement** in ROA, showing that CPC reductions can lead to marginal gains for certain publishers.
